"I am a junior web front-end developer, Myoung-Hwa Shin! I enjoy hanging out with friends, listening to music, watching movies, and participating in study groups to learn. I am growing by developing with my colleagues. I like to listen carefully to my colleagues, coordinate opinions, and develop from various perspectives.I am interested in improving user experience and studying web accessibility. Recently, I have been studying Core JavaScript."
